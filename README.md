## Description
In this project we had to create for a tech blog to write about all of the up and coming technology for web development. I created the config folder to contatin the connection to the database. The controller folder contains all of the routes for the website as well as the api routes. The db folder contains the schema that creats the database that needs to be created. The models folder contain the structure of the sql created by sequlize. The public folder contains all of the javascript and css that the website will use. The seeds folder is what is used to create the test data for the website. The utils folder contains the auth method to only allow specific users to change post and user data. The folder also contains the helpers file to pluralize the coments word. The last folder veiws contains all of the html for the website in handlebar files. The files is divide between layout which the navigation bar for the whole website, Partials which will be used to add the post and comments and the different webpages them selfes. the last file I had to create was the server file which is used to create the port set up the handlebars.
